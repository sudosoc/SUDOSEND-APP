## Features

**Sharing**
- Files of any size, **whole folders** (structure kept), and **text / clipboard**
- **Share sheet** on Android: *Share → SUDOSEND* from any app
- **Drag & drop** and right-click **Send to** on desktop
- **Resume**: a dropped transfer continues where it stopped
- **Background transfers** on Android: keeps going with the screen off or the app closed, with progress in a notification; optional *receive in the background*
- **Notifications** with Accept / Decline right from the notification
- **History** of every transfer, with *Open* and *Show in folder*

**Paid elsewhere — free here**
- 📋 **Universal clipboard** — copy on one device, paste on your others (Pushbullet charges for this)
- 🌐 **Share with any browser** — send to *and receive from* a device that doesn't have the app,
  even an iPhone: it scans a QR and gets a download/upload page (Send Anywhere / Feem-style)
- 📶 **No Wi-Fi? Make one** — Android creates a private hotspot; the other phone joins by scanning a QR
- 🔒 **Protected, self-destructing links** — PIN, expiry (10 min – 2 h), one-download links (WeTransfer Pro / Send Anywhere Plus)
- 📬 **Outbox** — send to a trusted device that's switched off; it's delivered the moment it comes online,
  and dropped connections **retry and resume automatically**
- 📂 **Hot folders** (desktop) — drop anything into `SUDOSEND Outbox/<device>/` and it's sent by itself (Resilio-style)
- 🔔 **Find my device** — make your phone ring at full volume, even on silent (AirDroid Premium)
- 🚦 **Upload speed limit** and 📊 **per-device data usage**
- 🔄 **Two-way folder sync** — keep a folder identical on two trusted devices; older versions go to
  an archive, deletions are never propagated (Resilio Sync Pro / SyncBack Pro-style)
- 🗜️ **Smart compression** — text, code, logs and documents shrink on the wire; photos and videos are left alone
- 🖼️ **Previews before accepting** — see thumbnails of incoming photos before you say yes
- 💬 **Messages** — encrypted text threads between your trusted devices
- ⚡ **Real speed test** — measures actual encrypted throughput between two devices, not a link-rate guess
- 📺 **Android TV** (remote/D-pad) and a compact mode for small screens / Wear OS
- 🧾 Signed delivery receipts, multi-device send, no file-size limits, no ads, no account

Every extra can be switched off in **Settings → Features**, and each one has an **(i)** button that
explains what it does, in English and Arabic.

**Only in SUDOSEND**
- **Signed proof of delivery** — every transfer ends with a receipt the *receiver's device key* signs:
  who sent what to whom, when, and the SHA-256 of every file. Export it and anyone can check it
  offline with `sudosend verify receipt.json`. Built for evidence handling, audits and "I never got it" disputes.
- **Send to several devices at once** — select devices, one tap
- **Pipe anything from the terminal** — `tar c project | sudosend send - --name project.tar --to laptop`
- **Received links open with one tap**, received text can go **straight to the clipboard**
- **A folder per sender** and a **JSON transfer log** export

**Security**
- **End-to-end encryption**: X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305, fresh keys per transfer
- **QR pairing**: scan once → both devices trust each other, no code to compare
- **MITM-proof first contact** otherwise: 6-digit code backed by a hash commitment
- **Trusted / blocked devices**, **auto-accept** for trusted ones
- **Flood protection**: connection rate limits per IP, one prompt per device, block list
- **Private key in the OS key store** (Android Keystore, Windows DPAPI)
- **Stealth mode**: stop announcing yourself; reachable only by QR or IP
- **SHA-256 verification** of every file; path-traversal-safe receiver

**App**
- **Arabic and English**, full right-to-left layout
- **Glassmorphism UI** with three effect levels — *Balanced* (default) keeps the glass look
  without live blur, *Lite* is automatic on Raspberry Pi and low-end phones
- **CLI** for Linux, Windows and macOS — prints a pairing QR right in the terminal

## Install

All files are on the **[Releases page](https://github.com/sudosoc/SUDOSEND-APP/releases/latest)** —
each one is labelled with its system in parentheses, e.g. **SUDOSEND (Android) — arm64-v8a**.

### Which file do I download?

| Your device | Download | Install with |
|---|---|---|
| Android — most phones (64-bit) | `sudosend-android-arm64-v8a.apk` | tap it |
| Android — older 32-bit phones | `sudosend-android-armeabi-v7a.apk` | tap it |
| Android — emulator / Chromebook | `sudosend-android-x86_64.apk` | tap it |
| Android — not sure | `sudosend-android-universal.apk` (works everywhere, bigger) | tap it |
| Windows 10 / 11 | `sudosend-windows-x64-setup.exe` | double-click |
| Windows (no install) | `sudosend-windows-x64-portable.zip` | unzip, run `sudosend.exe` |
| Kali / Debian / Ubuntu / Mint on a **PC or laptop** | `sudosend_<version>_amd64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./sudosend_*_amd64.deb` |
| Kali / Raspberry Pi OS / Ubuntu on a **Raspberry Pi** or other ARM board | `sudosend_<version>_arm64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./sudosend_*_arm64.deb` |
| Fedora / Arch / openSUSE / other Linux | `sudosend-linux-x64.tar.gz` or `sudosend-linux-arm64.tar.gz` | `./install.sh` |
| Mac (Apple Silicon or Intel) | `sudosend-macos.zip` | unzip, drag to Applications |
| iPhone / iPad | `sudosend-ios-unsigned.ipa` | sideload (see below) |

> **Linux: x64 or arm64?** Run `uname -m`.
> `x86_64` → **x64 / amd64**. `aarch64` → **arm64** (every Raspberry Pi 3/4/5 running a 64-bit OS).
> Running the wrong one gives `exec format error`.

### Android

1. Download the APK for your phone's CPU (almost every phone from 2017 on is **arm64-v8a**;
   check *Settings → About phone*, or a CPU-info app — if unsure take **universal**).
2. Open it. Android asks to allow installs from this source (your browser or file manager). Allow it, go back, and tap **Install**.
3. Open **SUDOSEND**. Received files are saved in **Download/SUDOSEND**.

> Play Protect may warn about an unknown developer, because the APK is not from the Play Store. Choose **Install anyway**.

### Windows

1. Download `sudosend-windows-x64-setup.exe` and run it.
2. If SmartScreen shows *Windows protected your PC*, click **More info → Run anyway** (the installer is not code-signed yet).
3. Keep the default options:
   - **Allow SUDOSEND through Windows Firewall** opens the network ports for you. Without it, other devices can't find this PC.
   - **Add `sudosend` to PATH** enables the command-line tool in any terminal.
4. Launch SUDOSEND from the Start menu.

Received files go to **Downloads\SUDOSEND**.

### Linux — Kali, Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS

Check your CPU with `uname -m`, download the matching `.deb`, then:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sudo apt install ./sudosend_*_arm64.deb     # Raspberry Pi / ARM (aarch64)
# or
sudo apt install ./sudosend_*_amd64.deb     # PC / laptop (x86_64)
```

`apt` installs everything SUDOSEND needs (GTK, zenity) automatically. Then:

- Open **SUDOSEND** from the applications menu (*Internet* / *Network* category), **or**
- type `sudosend` in a terminal.

> Keep the `./` in front of the file name. Without it, apt searches its repositories instead of the local file.

### Linux — any other distro

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xzf sudosend-linux-arm64.tar.gz     # or sudosend-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd sudosend
./install.sh
```

The installer does everything for you:

1. checks the file matches your CPU,
2. installs GTK 3 and zenity if missing (apt / dnf / pacman / zypper),
3. installs SUDOSEND to `~/.local/share/sudosend`. Use `sudo ./install.sh` to install to `/opt/sudosend` for every user,
4. creates the `sudosend` command and an applications-menu entry,
5. adds `~/.local/bin` to your PATH if needed,
6. offers to open the firewall ports if `ufw` or `firewalld` is active.

Add `--yes` to answer every question with yes. Open a new terminal afterwards so the `sudosend` command is found.

> Just want to try it without installing? `./sudosend` inside the extracted folder works too.

### macOS

1. Download `sudosend-macos.zip`, unzip it and drag **SUDOSEND** into *Applications*.
2. The app is not notarized yet: the first time, **right-click → Open → Open**
   (or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SUDOSEND.app`).
3. Allow *local network* access when macOS asks — otherwise devices can't find each other.

### iPhone / iPad

There is no App Store build yet (that needs a paid Apple developer account). You can sideload the
unsigned IPA with a free Apple ID using [AltStore](https://altstore.io) or
[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io): load `sudosend-ios-unsigned.ipa`, sign in, install.
Free-account installs must be refreshed every 7 days.

On iPhone, Apple blocks network discovery for unapproved apps, so **use QR pairing or *IP / link***:
scan the QR on the other device's Receive tab. Received files are in the **Files** app →
*On My iPhone → SUDOSEND*.

### One-line install (Linux)

Detects your CPU and distro, downloads the right file and installs it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudosoc/SUDOSEND-APP/main/get.sh | bash
```

> While the repository is **private**, this needs the GitHub CLI logged in (`sudo apt install gh && gh auth login`). Without it, download the file from the Releases page manually.

---

## First transfer

1. Open SUDOSEND on **both** devices, connected to the **same Wi-Fi or hotspot**.
2. On the sender, open the **Send** tab, then pick **Files**, **Folder** or **Text**.
3. Tap the receiver in **Nearby devices**.
4. Both screens show the same **6-digit code**. On the receiver, check it matches, then tap **Accept**.
   Tick **Trust this device** to skip the code next time.
5. Done. Every file is SHA-256 verified before it is saved.

**Faster: QR pairing.** On the receiver open **Receive**; on the phone tap **Scan QR** (Send tab).
Both devices now trust each other — no code, no prompt, now and next time.

If a device doesn't appear, use **IP / link** on the Send tab and type the IP shown on the receiver's
**Receive** tab (or paste its pairing link).

## Command line

Installed together with the app (`.deb`, `install.sh`, or the Windows installer with *Add to PATH*):

```bash
sudosend                                    # no arguments → opens the app
sudosend receive                            # wait for files, asks before accepting
sudosend receive --yes --trust --once       # unattended, exit after one transfer
sudosend receive --qr                       # print a pairing QR in the terminal
sudosend send report.pdf photos/ --to laptop      # device name (prefix) …
sudosend send --text "https://…" --to 192.168.1.20  # … or IP address
sudosend send file.iso --to 'sudosend://pair?…'     # … or a pairing link
sudosend devices                            # list devices on the network
sudosend id --name Seif-Pi                  # show/rename this device
tar c dir | sudosend send - --name dir.tar --to pi   # send from a pipe (stdin)
sudosend receive --receipts ~/receipts      # keep a signed receipt for every transfer
sudosend verify ~/receipts/receipt-*.json   # check receipts offline
sudosend web report.pdf                     # QR + link: any browser can download it
sudosend web --upload                       # let browsers send files to you
sudosend web secret.pdf --pin 4821 --max 1  # PIN-protected, self-destructs after 1 download
sudosend ring --to phone                    # find my phone (trusted devices)
sudosend send big.iso --to nas --limit 5M   # cap upload speed
sudosend speedtest --to laptop              # real encrypted throughput (trusted devices)
sudosend --help
```

Standalone binaries (`sudosend-cli-*`) are on the Releases page for servers without a desktop.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `exec format error` on Linux | Wrong CPU build. `uname -m` says `aarch64` → use the **arm64** file. `x86_64` → **x64/amd64**. |
| `sudosend: command not found` after `./install.sh` | Open a new terminal, or run `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`. |
| Devices don't see each other | Same Wi-Fi? Guest, campus and café Wi-Fi often block device-to-device traffic (*client isolation*), so use a phone hotspot instead. Or use **By IP**. |
| Linux: other devices can't find mine | Firewall. `sudo ufw allow 47823/udp && sudo ufw allow 47824:47833/tcp && sudo ufw allow 47840:47849/tcp` (the last range is browser share) |
| Windows: other devices can't find the PC | Re-run the installer with the firewall option, or allow SUDOSEND on **Private** networks. Make sure the Wi-Fi network is set to *Private*, not *Public*. |
| *Pick files* does nothing on Linux | Install zenity: `sudo apt install zenity` |
| Window is blank or very slow on a Raspberry Pi | Use a 64-bit OS with the desktop (X11/Wayland) running. On very old boards, the CLI is lighter: `sudosend receive`. |
| *Fingerprint mismatch* error | Something on the network answered pretending to be that device. The transfer was blocked on purpose. |
| Android stops mid-transfer | Allow notifications for SUDOSEND (the transfer runs as a foreground service), and on Xiaomi/Huawei/Samsung set battery usage to *Unrestricted*. |
| Android: "App not installed" when updating | The new APK is signed with a different key than the installed one (only happens once, when moving to release-signed builds). Uninstall, then install. |
| Laggy UI on a Raspberry Pi or old phone | Settings → Visual effects → **Lite** (automatic on Raspberry Pi and low-RAM phones). |
| Browser link doesn't open on the other device | Both must be on the same Wi-Fi/hotspot; allow TCP 47840–47849 in your firewall. |
| Folder sync doesn't start | Both devices must trust each other and be online; check *Settings → Features → Folder sync*. Not available on iOS. |
| Speed test is refused | The other device must trust you and have *Allow speed tests* on. |
| Watch (Wear OS) doesn't see devices | Watches usually reach the network through the phone's Bluetooth link, where LAN discovery doesn't work. Turn on the watch's own Wi-Fi (same network), or use **By IP**. |
| Hotspot won't start (Android) | Turn off the normal hotspot/tethering, turn on Location (Android ≤ 12), allow *Nearby devices*. |
| Updated the app and devices ask for the code again | The device key couldn't be unlocked (e.g. OS key store reset) and was recreated — pair again. |

---

## Uninstall

| Installed with | Remove with |
|---|---|
| `.deb` | `sudo apt remove sudosend` |
| `install.sh` | `sudosend --uninstall` |
| Windows installer | *Settings → Apps → SUDOSEND → Uninstall* |
| Android | long-press the icon → *Uninstall* |
| macOS | drag SUDOSEND from Applications to the Trash |

Received files in `Downloads/SUDOSEND` are never deleted.
